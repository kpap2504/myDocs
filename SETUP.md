# Project Setup
We start by creating a React application using Vite, and adding TypeScript. You can choose to use Create React App if you prefer. We install Tailwind CSS for styling and theming.

To begin the project, we’ll set up [React Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/), an ultra-fast tool for React applications. If you haven’t already, globally install it using either [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).
```
yarn install
```

```
yarn global add create-vite
```

Use React Vite to create a new project with TypeScript support. You can rename variables-theme-app with your preferred project name. You can also select the features you need when prompted by Vite in the command line:
```
create-vite variables-theme-app .
```

Afterward, access the project directory using this command:
``` 
cd variables-theme-app
```

You can start the development server now to preview your app:
```
yarn run dev
```

Access the local development URL in your browser. Follow [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite) installation from its official guide.
